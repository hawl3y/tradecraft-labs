## Content Structure Summary

### Project (1 document)

All frontmatter fields populated. `startDate: "TBD"` per the no-fabrication instruction — the original start date cannot be determined from source materials. Key fields:

- `slug: "project-001-biso"` (permanent URL)
- `projectNumber: "001"`
- `status: "active"`
- `stage: "interviews"`
- `featured: true`
- `thesisVersion: 2`
- `startDate: "TBD"`
- `updatedDate: "2026-06-23"`
- Computed URL: `/research/project-001-biso`

### Artifacts (9 documents)

**3 full-body artifacts** — sourced from `.txt` research files:

- `biso-research-insights` (v2, status: active) — 12 insights, conceptual model (Trust → Communication → Governance → Risk-Informed Decisions), practitioner themes, research gap, working thesis v2, emerging ideas, future validation areas, initiative vision
- `biso-research-data` (v1, status: active) — 3 practitioner observations, 3 case studies, recurring patterns, implications
- `biso-interview-analysis` (v1, status: active) — structured analysis template with sections for key themes, evidence, new directions, follow-up questions

**6 stub artifacts** — `.docx`-sourced, pending Phase 7 conversion:

| Slug | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `biso-research-proposal` | research-proposal | Full research proposal submitted for GT MS Cybersecurity program |
| `biso-literature-matrix` | literature-matrix | Source matrix across 7 sub-areas; 15 sources mapped to research themes |
| `biso-annotated-bibliography` | annotated-bibliography | 15 annotated sources spanning governance theory, NIST CSF 2.0, COBIT, and BISO literature |
| `biso-interview-guide` | interview-guide | Semi-structured guide; 5 core questions + role-specific follow-up prompts |
| `biso-interview-pool` | interview-pool | 8 practitioners across 6 functional perspectives |
| `biso-paper-outline` | paper-outline | Proposed paper structure covering governance intermediary framework, mixed methodology, findings by theme |

All artifact `createdDate` and `updatedDate` fields set to `"TBD"` — none were determinable from source materials. All computed URLs follow `/research/project-001-biso/artifacts/[slug]`.

### Journal (1 entry)

- `2026-06-23-platform-launch` — date: `2026-06-23` (accurate), category: `milestone`
- Body documents platform launch, completed research stages, current interview phase, working thesis v2, and what comes next
- Written in first person from the researcher's perspective
- Computed URL: `/journal/2026-06-23-platform-launch`

### Publications (0 documents)

Directory remains empty. A publication entry will be created when a paper draft is ready.

## Contentlayer Validation Results

```
Generated 11 documents in .contentlayer

Projects:       1  (project-001-biso | active | interviews)
Artifacts:      9  (3 active, 6 stub)
Journal:        1  (2026-06-23-platform-launch | milestone)
Publications:   0

Build:          ✓ Compiled successfully
TypeScript:     ✓ Linting and type checking passed
Static pages:   ✓ 8/8 generated
```

All 11 documents parsed and typed cleanly. No schema validation errors. `"TBD"` placeholder values pass Contentlayer's `string` field type validation. Six stub artifacts render minimal placeholder body content without MDX parsing errors. All computed URL fields resolve correctly.

---

## Key Decisions

- **No fabricated dates.** All unknown dates use `"TBD"` string. Only `date: "2026-06-23"` on the journal entry is accurate (today's date at time of platform launch).
- **Stub artifact system.** Allows all artifact routes to resolve and all artifact cards to render before `.docx` conversion begins in Phase 7. Stubs carry full frontmatter + description; body content is a single placeholder sentence.
- **Source separation maintained.** Original source files in `/research/` are untouched. Web-optimized MDX versions live in `/content/`. Both coexist in the repository.

## Issues Encountered

None. Phase 2 completed without errors.
